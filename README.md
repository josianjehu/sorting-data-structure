# sorting-data-structure

# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
I was having quite a few issues with understanding how the algorithms worked. Sorting was specially troublesome but I was able to grasp the idea and how they worked. While programming I also ran into a few problems specially in the last project. While programming the last project I ran into an issue where I was feeding the program a file called courses.css.txt and I wasnt able to get the information sent to the program for line parsing.
# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
For the first problem I had I ended up watching YouTube videos and reading more about it on programming websites online which were helpful. As for the second problem it took me some time but after analyzing the situation I saw that the program kept ending when I ran .open() therefore I knew that the issue lied with the file that was being fed.
# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Most of the roadblocks I encountered I was able to solve by reading through forums and if I needed a specific function to do something I would further research the function by going through the C++ documentations which is helpful. 
# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs? 
This was the first time I actually used soring algorithms and I enjoyed quite a bit I didnt think it was going to be so entertaining. I tend to program using documentations and forums quite a bit and if there is already previously written code on an algorithm I tend to copy/paste it, analyze it, then modify it to fit the code that I have. Doing this gets me used to seeing others peoples code and also at analyzing code written in different ways.
# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I have gotten much more used to using pointers and structs which I previously didnt use much because I didnt know how to properly use them. This course was an eye opener into C++ and how to properly program in that language. I still believe I need more practice on using pointers but I have gotten much more used to them.
